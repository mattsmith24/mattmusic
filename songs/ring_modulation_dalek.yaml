#     The ring modulator is best known as the device used to create the
#     terrifying voices of the Daleks and the Cybermen in Dr. Who.

#     The ring modulator works by taking two inputs and multiplying them
#     together. In the original Ring Modulator a tape loop with a 30Hz sine wave
#     tone was combined in real time as an actor spoke into a microphone. The
#     diodes in the machine also gave the effect its characteristic distortion.

# There is more to making a dalek sound than just this 30Hz ring modulator but
# it gets you most of the way there. The above website simulates the diode
# bridge to add distortion which is pretty cool.
