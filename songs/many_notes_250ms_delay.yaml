# This file plays the many notes example using a sinewave that is delayed by
# 250ms. In this case the delayed note overlaps with the next note in the
# sequence so the notes harmonise with each other. This mimics a musical
# technique called a canon where the harmony is the melody delayed by one or
# more notes.
