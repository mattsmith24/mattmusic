# This is a reference for comparing filters. The pulse train is used as an input
# to filters to see the response
#
# In audacity, the "analyse" spectrum plot with Hann window size of 32768 shows
# this as a smooth line from -74dB to -75dB at 7800Hz, -76dB at 11200Hz, -77dB
# at 13700Hz to -81dB at 22000Hz. If you then analyse the output of a filter
# that used the pulse train as an input, you can see where it deviates from that
# curve.
