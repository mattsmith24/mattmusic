# A one-pole low-pass filter. This simple filter is not really used for audio
# but can smooth a human input such as turning a knob or moving a fader. The
# pole lies on the real axis at a value < 1. The design of the filter comes from
# choosing the "half-power" point which is the frequency at which the input
# power is halfed. For values a lot less than 1/4 of sample frequency, the
# approximation p = 1 - w can be used where w is the angular frequency of the
# desired half-power point.
