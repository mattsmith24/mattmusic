# This file plays the many notes example using a sinewave that is delayed by
# 50ms with recircualting delay. The delay can be heard as a kind of gargling.
# This is because delays above 20ms start to be audible as separate events to
# the human ear where as delays below 20ms are not. The filtering aspect of the
# delay still plays a part - certain frequencies will be attenuated but that
# aspect is heard less than the change to the attack.
