# This file plays the many notes example using a sinewave that is delayed by
# 250ms with recirculating delay. In this case the delayed note overlaps with
# the next note in the sequence so the notes harmonise with each other. As the
# notes layer over each other, the ear hears a large building or tunnel echoing.
