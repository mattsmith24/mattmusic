# This file plays a sound and mixes it with a copy of itself delayed by 10ms.
# When the delay in this kind of network is less than 20ms, then the effect is
# heard as a filter. In this case a non-recirculating comb filter results with
# peaks at multiple of w = 2*pi / d (at sample rate 44000, this is every 100 Hz )
