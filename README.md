Learning rust by writing a music thing

I made this to learn rust by implementing an idea I had about a kind of functional
music project where I would programatically create music starting with fundamental
waveforms. I thought I could start with a sinewave and then keep adding filters until
I made a song. Since then, it's moved towards yet another soft synthesiser but I'm
still going with it because I'm learning things about sythesis and DSP as I go and
hope to still make something interesting.

To start with this, try `cargo run arpeggios vibraphone`. The main.rs file lists a
few other built-in songs and instruments. I hope to create a YAML file format to
use with this or even a Pure Data style interface.
