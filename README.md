Learning rust by writing a music thing

I made this to learn rust by implementing an idea I had about a kind of
functional music project where I would programatically create music starting
with fundamental waveforms. I thought I could start with a sinewave and then
keep adding filters until I made a song. Since then, it's moved towards yet
another soft synthesiser but I'm still going with it because I'm learning things
about sythesis and DSP as I go and hope to still make something interesting.

To start with this, try `cargo run -s arpeggios -i vibraphone`. The main.rs file
lists a few other built-in songs and instruments. I hope to create a YAML file
format to use with this or even a Pure Data style interface.

The more I get into this project, the more I realise that there is an enormous
field of learning that it would take me many years to master (but that's no
reason not to have a go as long as I'm having fun!). If you are looking for
mature projects, here are a few much better music making tools that have some
similar vibes as my project.
